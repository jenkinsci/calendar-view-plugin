## Features

* Provides a month, week and day view of past and future builds
* Indicates status of past builds by color
* Displays when future scheduled builds will happen
* Shows estimated duration of future scheduled builds
* Configurable date and time settings

## Usage

### 1. Create a new view

Select the *Calendar View* option and give the view a name.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


### 2. Configure the view

Select the jobs whose builds should be displayed in the view and customize the view to your liking:

Tip: to be more flexible in selecting the jobs use the 
[View Job Filters Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/view-job-filters-plugin).

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


### 3. Open the view

This will show all the past and future builds for the jobs that you have selected in the previous step.

Note: there is currently no auto refresh available.

#### Past builds

Past builds will appear in four different colors:
* *Successfull* builds will be *blue*
* *Failed* builds will be *red*
* *Unstable* builds will be *yellow*
* *Aborted* builds will be *dark gray*

Clicking on a past build will lead to that specific build's detail page.

#### Future builds

*Future* builds are *light gray with a dashed border*.

Clicking on a future build will lead to the job's detail page.

## Development

Clone the repository then execute the following in the project's root directory:

```
$ mvn install
```

This will install Java dependencies as well as a local node installation and npm dependencies.

You can now run the plugin in a Jenkins instance by executing the following:

```
$ mvn hpi:run
```

To watch JavaScript and CSS files using webpack:

```
$ npm run dev
```

## Use Calendar View with Job DSL

Calendar View integrates also with Job DSL.

Simple example with nestedView:

```
nestedView('Job Schedule') {
    description('Description')
    views {
        calendarView {
            name('CalendarName')
            description('Description')
            includeRegex('.*')
            jobFilters {
                statusFilter {
                    statusFilter(true)
                }
            }
            jobNames([].toSet())
            recurse(true)
        }
    }
}
```

Simple example with folder:

```
folder('MyProject') {
    views {
        calendarView {
            name('CalendarName')
            description('Description')
            includeRegex('.*')
            jobFilters {
                statusFilter {
                    statusFilter(true)
                }
            }
            jobNames([].toSet())
            recurse(true)
        }
    }
}
```
